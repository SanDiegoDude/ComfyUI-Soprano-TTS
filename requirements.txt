# Soprano TTS Node Requirements
# ==============================================================================
#
# IMPORTANT: soprano-tts cannot be auto-installed via requirements.txt because
# it needs --no-deps flag to avoid upgrading PyTorch and breaking ComfyUI.
#
# MANUAL INSTALLATION REQUIRED:
#
# 1. Activate your ComfyUI Python environment:
#    - Linux/Mac: source /shared-big/ComfyUI/venv/bin/activate
#    - Windows: \path\to\ComfyUI\venv\Scripts\activate
#
# 2. Install soprano-tts WITHOUT dependencies:
#    pip install soprano-tts --no-deps
#
# 3. Install minimal required dependencies:
#    pip install unidecode
#
# That's it! scipy and transformers are already in ComfyUI.
#
# WHY --no-deps IS REQUIRED:
# soprano-tts depends on lmdeploy which requires PyTorch 2.8+ and will upgrade
# your PyTorch from 2.5.1 to 2.9.1, breaking ComfyUI. Using --no-deps bypasses
# this and uses the transformers backend instead (still very fast!).
#
# VERIFICATION:
# Run: python /shared-big/ComfyUI/custom_nodes/ComfyUI-Soprano-TTS/test_compat.py
# Should output: "✅ ALL TESTS PASSED! Soprano TTS should work!"
#
# For detailed troubleshooting, see INSTALL_WORKAROUND.md
# ==============================================================================

# Dependencies that CAN be auto-installed (already in ComfyUI typically):
scipy>=1.10.0
transformers>=4.30.0

# Dependencies that MUST be manually installed:
# soprano-tts  # Install with: pip install soprano-tts --no-deps
unidecode>=1.3.0
